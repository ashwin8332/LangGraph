LangGraph is an open-source framework built by LangChain that streamlines the creation and management of AI agent workflows. At its core, LangGraph combines large language models (LLMs) with graph-based architectures allowing developers to map, organize and optimize how AI agents interact and make decisions.
By treating workflows as interconnected nodes and edges, LangGraph offers a scalable, transparent and developer-friendly way to design advanced AI systems ranging from simple chatbots to multi-agent system.
